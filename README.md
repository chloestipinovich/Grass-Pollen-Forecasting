# Grass Pollen Forecasting
This is the repository used in the making of Grass Pollen in Cape Town: A Comparison of Generalised Additive Models nd Random Forests by Sky Cope and ChloÃ« Stipinovich. The final ppaer can be found under the [documents folder]()


grass pollen forecasting model and platform for Cape Town using weather from the South African Astronomical Observatory (SAAO). Random forests and generalised additive models were both considered and compared in the modelling process.

This is the repo for the paper Clustering Ward-Level Poverty Using Satellite Imagery by Ryan Anderson and Andomei Smit. The aim of this research is to cluster Gauteng wards based on their level of poverty and, as a result, create a poverty map. Furthermore, the clustering is purely based on publicly available data - assessing the potential for poverty mapping without the use of census data. Since high-resolution satellite imagery is publicly available, the wards will be clustered from the information that can be extracted from this imagery.

The general methodology followed in the paper is as follows:

Step 1: Obtain a set of satellite images for each of the Gauteng wards
Step 2: Extract a feature set for the wards from the satellite imagery using a pre-trained CNN
Step 3: Reduce the dimensions of the features and then cluster using K-means and HDBSCAN
